- 👋 Hi, I’m @Stuvers and this is my GitHub Profile. I'm wanting to display my creativity (or lack thereof) on here for the world to see.
- 👀 I'm interested in developing my skills and making something that I find personally unique and interesting. Therefore, I want to learn new languages, I want new project ideas
      and overall, I just want to make something I can be proud of as a software developer.
- 🌱 I’m currently trying to do a few things and as most people are on here, a few too many things. I want to get my C# skills back on track and try to make a beloved project
      I've had planned for a while. My item swapping application called Razmena. Of course, I don't want to limit myself with C#, but for now, I'm starting with what's familiar. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that's interesting. Social interactions are what drive us so anything that get us all that little bit closer together, than
      that's fantastic. I would like to make a moral difference, so if anyone is working on environmental or a good cause that'd they think I'd be interested in. Give me a shout.
- 📫 I'm not quite sure on this yet, but I'll update this shortly!
